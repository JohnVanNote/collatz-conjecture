This is a simple C++ program which represents the steps it takes for a positive integer to reach 1, see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture

There should be two files in addition to this README:
- collatz-conjecture.cpp - The source code
- makefile - builds/test case

In order to build the program run the following, replacing the value of ARG with the value you want to test
```bash
make run ARG=100
```
